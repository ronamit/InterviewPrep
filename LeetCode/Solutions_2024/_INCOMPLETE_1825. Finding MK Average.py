    """
    I solved by mistake the case where look at all history and not just the last m times..
    see a correct solution here:
    https://leetcode.com/problems/finding-mk-average/solutions/3938332/python3-keeping-three-containers-for-small-middle-large-values-runtime-98-memory-94/?envType=company&envId=google&favoriteSlug=google-thirty-daysÂ´


    Note that my solution can be correctd if we add a queue of the last m elements with a pointer to their node in the heaps so we can remove old elements in O(log(k))
    but it will require to implment the heap from scratch - to allow removing any elements (using sift-up and pop root)

    Solution idea:
    * we don't need to keep track of all the inserted numbers..
    just their sum and the the values of the k-bottom and k-top numbers
    seen
    we can keep those numbers in two heaps, max heap for the k-bottom
    and min heap for the k-top .
    we also keep a variable for the sum of each.
    when adding elemnt we insert it to one of them if needed. O(log(k))
    calculateMKAverage  is O(1) - total_sum - k_smallest_sum - k_largest_sum
